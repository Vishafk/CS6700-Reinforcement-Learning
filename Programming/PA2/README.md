# Reinforcement Learning - Control Algorithms 

Implementation of various control algoriths using OpenAI Gym

## Algorithms

1. QLearning
2. SARSA
3. SARSA with Eligibility Traces
4. Policy Gradients

## Description

QLearning and SARSA are performed on a discrete grid world.

Policy Gradients is performed on a continous action space environment.

Evolution of reward value, number of steps taken for convergence, etc is used to evaluate the performance of an algorithm.

## USAGE

First, install and create the environments in your local system using OpenAI Gym and then run the algorithms using the given python and IPython Jupyter Notebook files

## Dependencies

* gym
* IPython3
* numpy
* matplotlib
